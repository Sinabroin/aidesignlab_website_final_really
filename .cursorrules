# General Rules
- Always prioritize concise, readable, and maintainable code.
- Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles aggressively.
- When modifying code, check if the change renders existing code obsolete. If so, remove the dead code.
- Avoid large files. If a file exceeds 300 lines, suggest splitting it into smaller modules.
- Do not leave commented-out code (legacy code). Just remove it.
- Use modern syntax (e.g., arrow functions, async/await, destructuring).

# Refactoring Instructions
- Before adding new features, scan the file for duplication.
- If a function does more than one thing, split it.
- Extract repeated JSX patterns into reusable components.
- Consolidate similar state management logic.
- Remove unused imports and variables immediately.

# React/Next.js Specific
- Prefer functional components over class components.
- Use hooks effectively (useState, useEffect, useMemo, useCallback).
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks when appropriate.
- Keep components under 200 lines. If larger, split into sub-components.
- Co-locate related components in the same directory.

# TypeScript
- Define interfaces for all props and state.
- Avoid `any` type. Use proper typing.
- Extract repeated type definitions into shared types file.

# File Organization
- Group related functionality together.
- Separate business logic from presentation logic.
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) for cleaner imports.

# Performance
- Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo.
- Memoize callbacks with useCallback when passed to child components.
- Lazy load heavy components when possible.

# Project Structure Rules
- New page sections must go in `components/sections/`
- Common UI components must go in `components/common/`
- All type definitions must be in `types/index.ts`
- Mock data must be centralized in `data/mockData.ts`
- Constants must be in `lib/constants.ts`
- Requirements must be in `config/requirements.ts`

# Component Naming Conventions
- Page components: `*Page` (e.g., AdminPage)
- Section components: `*Section` (e.g., HomeSection)
- Common UI: Noun form (e.g., TabButton, GalleryCard)
- Modals: `*Modal` (e.g., GalleryModal)

# Color Usage
- Always use colors from `lib/constants.ts` COLORS object
- Primary: #87CEEB (Sky Blue)
- Primary Light: #B0E0E6
- Accent: #4A90A4
- Never hardcode color values directly in components

# REQ Implementation
- When implementing admin features, map to specific REQ ID
- Document REQ ID in comments above implementation
- Keep REQ definitions in sync with `config/requirements.ts`

# Code Review Checklist
- File size < 300 lines
- No duplicate code (DRY)
- Types properly defined
- No unused imports/variables
- Consistent naming
- Colors from constants
- REQ mapping documented (for admin features)
