# Frontend Design Guidelines (Anthropic)
# source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/skills/main/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md

## Design Thinking (Before Coding)
- Purpose: What problem does this interface solve?
- Tone: Pick an extreme aesthetic direction with intentionality
- Constraints: Framework, performance, accessibility
- Differentiation: What's unforgettable?

## Aesthetics
- Typography: Distinctive font choices, avoid generic (Arial, Inter)
- Color: Commit to cohesive theme; dominant + sharp accents
- Motion: CSS-only preferred; high-impact page load > scattered micro-interactions
- Spatial: Unexpected layouts, asymmetry, generous negative space
- Backgrounds: Atmosphere and depth, not solid colors

## Anti-Patterns
- Generic AI aesthetics (purple gradients, system fonts)
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context
- Same choices across different designs
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Space Grotesk)

## Key Principle
Match implementation complexity to aesthetic vision.
Maximalist = elaborate code. Minimalist = restraint + precision.
